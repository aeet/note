- Classification of data structures
    - list
    - stack
    - queue
    - hash table
    - tree
    - heap
    - graph
- Logical structure: the logical structure reveals the logical relationships between data elements.
    - Linear
        - array
        - linked list
        - stack
        - queue
        - hash table
    - None-linear
        - tree
        - heap
        - graph
        - hash table
- Physical structure: contiguous and linked (or discrete)
    - during the execution of an algorithm, relevant data is stored in the memory.
    - the system accesses data at a target location through memory addresses.
    - the physical structure reflects how data is stored in computer memory and can be divided into contiguous space storage(arrays) and discrete space storage(linked lists).
    - all data structures are implemented based on arrays. linked lists, or a combination of both.
    - be implemented based on arrays
        - stack
        - queue
        - hash table
        - tree
        - heap
        - graph
        - matrix
        - tensor( an array with dimensions >= 3)
    - be implemented based on linked list
        - stack
