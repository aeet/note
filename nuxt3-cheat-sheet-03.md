# Components

## ClientOnly

- Render components only in client-side with the `<ClientOnly>` component.
    
- props
    
    - `placeholderTag | fallbackTag`: specify a tag to be rendered server-side.
    - `placeholder | fallback`: specify a content to be rendered server-side.

## DevOnly

- Render components only during development with the `<DevOnly>` component.
- slots
    - `#fallback`: if you ever require to have a replacement during production.

## NuxtClientFallback

- Nuxt provides the `<NuxtClientFallback>` component to render its content on the client if any of its children trigger an error in SSR
- events
    - `@ssr-error`: Event emitted when a child triggers an error in SSR. Note that this will only be triggered on the server.
- props
    - `placeholderTag | fallbackTag`: Specify a fallback tag to be rendered if the slot fails to render on the server.
    - `placeholder | fallback`: Specify fallback content to be rendered if the slot fails to render
    - `keepFallback`: Keep the fallback content if it failed to render server-side.
- slots
    - `#fallback`: specify content to be displayed server-side if the slot fails to render.

## NuxtPage

- The `<NuxtPage>` component is required to display pages located in the pages/ directory.
- props
    - `name`: tells RouterView to render the component with the corresponding name in the matched route record's components option.
    - `route`: route location that has all of its components resolved.
    - `pageKey`: control when the NuxtPage component is re-rendered.
    - `transition`: define global transitions for all pages rendered with the NuxtPage component.
    - `keepalive`: control state preservation of pages rendered with the NuxtPage component

## NuxtLayout

- Nuxt provides the `<NuxtLayout>` component to show layouts on pages and error pages.
- props
    - `name`: Specify a layout name to be rendered, can be a string, reactive reference or a computed property. It must match the name of the corresponding layout file in the `layouts/` directory.

## NuxtLink

- Nuxt provides `<NuxtLink>` component to handle any kind of links within your application.
- props
    - RouterLink
        - `to`: Any URL or a route location object from Vue Router.
        - `custom`: Whether `<NuxtLink>` should wrap its content in an `<a>` element. It allows taking full control of how a link is rendered and how navigation works when it is clicked. Works the same as Vue Router's custom prop.
        - `exactActiveClass`: A class to apply on exact active links. Works the same as Vue Router's exact-active-class prop on internal links. Defaults to Vue Router's default "router-link-exact-active").

        - `noRel`: If set to true, no rel attribute will be added to the link.
        - `external`: Forces the link to be rendered as an a tag instead of a Vue Router RouterLink.
        - `prefetch`: When enabled will prefetch middleware, layouts and payloads (when using payloadExtraction) of links in the viewport. Used by the experimental crossOriginPrefetch config.
        - `noPrefetch`: Disables prefetching.
        - `prefetchedClass`: A class to apply to links that have been prefetched.
    - Anchor
        - `target`: A target attribute value to apply on the link.

    - `duration`: Duration of the loading bar, in milliseconds (default 2000).
    - `throttle`: Throttle the appearing and hiding, in milliseconds (default 200).
    - `estimatedProgress`: By default Nuxt will back off as it approaches 100%. You can provide a custom function to customize the progress estimation, which is a function that receives the duration of the loading bar (above) and the elapsed time. It should return a value between 0 and 100.

- slots
    
    - `#fallback`: Specify the content to be rendered before the island loads (if the component is lazy) or if NuxtIsland fails to fetch the component.
- ref
    
    - `refresh()`: force refetch the server component by refetching it.
- events
    
    - error: emitted when when NuxtIsland fails to fetch the new island.
